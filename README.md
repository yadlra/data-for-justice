# Data for Justice


## Issue: Air pollution and its impact on public health, with a focus on the disproportionate impact on minorities and marginalized communities. 


    ### Introduction: Brainstorm questions they have about air pollution and its effects.

    ### Data exploration: Here is a dataset on air pollution in the UK, including data on levels of air pollution by location and information on how air pollution affects different groups of people (e.g. by race/ethnicity, socio-economic status). Explore the data and try to identify patterns or trends. 

    ### Visualization creation: Using a visualization tool (e.g. Excel, Google Charts, Tableau, etc.), create a data visualization that communicates a message about the disproportionate impact of air pollution on minorities in the UK. Choose a visualization type and customize the appearance of the visualization to effectively communicate their message.

    ### Analysis and interpretation: Analyze and interpret their visualization, thinking about what it is showing and what message it is communicating. Consider the limitations of the data and the visualization and how you might improve it.

    ### Sharing and communication: Share your visualization with the rest of the class and explain the key findings and message that it conveys.
